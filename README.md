ETS Ver. 1.22.x - MOD Ver. 1.14

This is a mod for the transmission ratio inside Euro Truck Simulator 1.22.x.

The transmission ratio for all the trucks that have variable gear ratios is 
stored in a Low Gear, High Gear and Medium Gear Ratio Mod. There are three major 
mod files after all modifications have been performed:

- zionid High Gear Ratio All Trucks.scs
- zionid Low Gear Ratio All Trucks.scs
- zionid Medium Gear Ratio All Trucks.scs

These files can be placed in the ETS2 MOD directory.
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\mod

Each SCS file contains the following files and folders:

- transmission.jpg
- manifest.sii
- Low Gear vs. High Gear Ratio.txt
- def [folder]

The DEF tree folder is a collection of all the original transmission files for 
each truck brand (as in the original game):

def\vehicle\truck\daf.xf\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\daf.xf_euro6\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\iveco.hiway\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\iveco.stralis\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\man.tgx\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\mercedes.actros\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\mercedes.actros2014\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\renault.magnum\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\renault.premium\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\scania.r\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\scania.streamline\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\volvo.fh16\transmission\
def\vehicle\truck\volvo.fh16_2012\transmission\

I only modified the 12_speed.sii, 12_speed_ret.sii and 12_speed_r.sii files.
(12_speed_r.sii seems to be a typo in the .\iveco.hiway\transmission\ folder)

IF THE ORIGINAL FILE DID NOT CONTAIN MULTIPLE VALUES FOR THE TRANSMISSION 
RATIO, THEN THE RATIO WAS LEFT AS IS (E.G. MERCEDES ACTROS 2014).

NO OTHER FILES ARE MODIFIED OR ADDED TO THE RESULTING SCS FILE THAT ARE NOT 
MENTIONED HERE. THE RESULTING MODS SHOULD FUNCTION TOGETHER WITH ANY OTHER MOD 
THAS HAS NOT MODIFIED THE 12_speed*.sii FILES. 

THIS IS A 100% PURE TRANSMISSION MOD! NO HIDDEN SOUNDS, GRAPHICS OR HINTS.
